# W3SideNavToBrightonProjectAdapt
Trying to build a responsive sidebar hamburger menu using Brighton Project https://github.com/odamak/BrightonTimesProject implementing the method by W3 School https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp <br /> Method by W3 School is the file: sidenav.html (used as a starting point to be implemented on index.html) <br /> My trial to implement it on responsive way: index.html, responsive.css <br /> I commented all the useless index.html lines for the menu  main.css is the file for general styling of index.html
